# My-Manjaro-i3
Writing my own i3 config is just like playing another Minecraft! (´・ω・`) 

### -- core --
* shell: bash with bash-completion
* terminal: xfce4-terminal
* bar: polybar (noto-font and microsoft-font needed)
* monitor: conky
* transparent: compton
* for-eye: redshift
* wallpaper: feh
* input method: fcitx with fcitx-sogoupinyin(aur)
* proxy: proxychains & shadowsocks

others which manjaro-i3 included: 
i3-scrot, lxappearance, xfce4-power-manager, blurlock, pulseaudio&pavucontrol
for more, turn to startup application

### -- CLI apps --
* file manager: ranger(w3m for preview image, atool for preview archives)
* editor: neovim
* media: ncmpcpp(mpc, mpd needed)
  the problem between mpd and pulseaudio: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Music_Player_Daemon/Tips_and_tricks#PulseAudio
* app-launcher: rofi
* common: the_silver_searcher

### -- GUI apps --
* file manager: thunar
* editor: vscode
* browser: firefox
* media: smplayer
* pdfreader: zathura
* ide: pycharm
* office: libreoffice
* note: leanote

### Idea about the keybinding
* Switch the Win key and the CapsLock. Now pressing the $mod key is easy: just move your left pinky.

* Frequently used operations(navigations, favorite apps) have been binding so that they are easily catched by the right hand without leaving the homerow.
